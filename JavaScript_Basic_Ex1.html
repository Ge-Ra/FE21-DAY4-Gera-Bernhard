    <!-- Basic
Ex 1
Create a form with input fields for your firstname, lastname and age.  
Extract the values from each input field and display them all in a separate div.

If the length of your name is larger than 5 characters, change the text colour to green. 
Otherwise, change the text-colour to red.  -->

    <h1>Enter your data:</h1>
    <form>
      <input
        type="text"
        class="input"
        name="firstname"
        placeholder="Enter your first name"
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        class="input"
        name="lastname"
        placeholder="Enter your last name"
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        class="input"
        name="age"
        placeholder="Enter your age"
      />
      <!-- <button id="btn">Submit</button> -->
      <input type="submit" id="btn" />
    </form>

    <div class="fname"></div>
    <div class="lname"></div>
    <div class="age"></div>

    <p id="result"></p>

    <!-- Ex 2
Extend the previous form to have a select option, where your profession can be selected. 
If you are working in IT, the background of the div displaying the information 
from the form will turn purple, 
if you work in hospitality, your div will turn yellow, etc. 

(Hint: extracting the selection value will work similarly to extracting the input values) -->

    <!-- Intermediate
Ex 1
Create a Javascript program that will make the Santa Clauses 
disappear on a click from the following 3x3 matrix. 
Only the clicked Santa Claus should disappear.-->

    <!-- Ex 2 | Dynamic Background
Create a JavaScript function to create random background colors 
each time we click a button that we had on the website.
Hint:
- Consider the RGB color code

- Consider the Global DOM built-in properties and methods -->

    <!-- Advanced
Create a circle and center it on the page. 

When you hover on the circle, you will see a message under it : 
"you are in the circle".

When the mouse leaves the circle you will see the message under it : 
"you are outside of the circle".

When you click on the circle, the background will change to gray.

When you double-click on the circle, the background will change to blue.  -->

    <!-- Challenge
Ex Description:
Many people love games of chance and especially the thrill of  "roll of the dice". 
For this exercise, create a page with a two-sided layout for two players based 
on the idea of "roll of the dice".

When the page loads, a prompt method should appear to receive a string 
(the name for each player), 
then display their names in the header of the page, for example, "Thomas vs. Martin".

In each half of the layout, place a button that calls a function. This function should 
create one random number. Next, display the number separately and visually appealing in 
each player's half, so that the player can see what they "rolled". 
Once both players have rolled, announce the winner based on the highest score! 
Do your best to create a rich game-design using CSS or Bootstrap. -->
